## 🍳 Minimalist fried rice (barebone version)

### Ingredients
- 3-4 smashed garlic cloves
- 1 onion, sliced
- ~2 portions cold rice (from fridge)
- 1-2 eggs
- Sesame oil or neutral oil (sunflower/croma)
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 heaping tsp sambal brandal
- 1/2 tsp MSG
- Toppings: seroendeng, fried shallots

### Method
1. Heat **sesame oil (or mix with neutral oil)** in pan until *just smoking*.
2. Reduce to medium, sauté garlic & onion until softened and aromatic.
3. Pour off excess oil if desired, keep some for flavor.
4. Push to side, scramble eggs on empty side of pan.
5. Add rice, crank heat to high, toss to combine.
6. Pour in sauce mix (soy, oyster, sambal, MSG), continue tossing on high.
7. Top with seroendeng & fried shallots.

### 📝 Notes on Maillard & tweaks
- **Maillard needs >140°C + dry surface.** Sesame oil smokes low (~175°C), so for max browning:
  - Start aromatics in neutral oil, drizzle sesame oil at finish.
- Let rice sit pressed on hot pan for 30-60 sec undisturbed to form crispy bits.
- Dry leftover rice gives better browning (less steam).
- You can add garlic *later* to avoid bitterness if pushing heat.

### 🍛 Flavor profile
- Umami heavy from soy/oyster/MSG, balanced by sweet kecap or sambal brandal.
- No veg this time — minimalist, pure rice-egg-onion-garlic test case.
- Perfect for weekday experiments.

## ✅ Iterations to explore
- Add leftover roasted veg (aubergine, sweet potato).
- Try peanut oil + sesame finish for stronger Maillard.
- Press rice for longer crispy "socarrat".
- Top with a fried egg instead of scrambling in.
