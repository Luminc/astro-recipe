## üáÆüáπ Cultural Notes & Tips

- **Amatriciana** originates from Amatrice, Lazio. The classic Roman version uses only guanciale, tomato, Pecorino, and chili.
- **No onion or garlic** in traditional recipes, though a smashed garlic clove is sometimes used and removed.
- **Gnocchi is unorthodox**, but it absorbs sauce beautifully and plays well with richness.
- **Peperoncino**: traditional versions bloom the chili in the pork fat. You can also use whole dried chilies torn by hand.
- **Use good Pecorino Romano**, preferably not pre-grated.
- **Don‚Äôt discard the guanciale fat** ‚Äî this ‚Äúfat-forward‚Äù edition uses it all for flavor and texture.
