# Gnocchi all’Amatriciana — Fat-Forward Edition
*A Roman-inspired classic with full guanciale fat and deep flavor*

## 🧂 Ingredients
- 500g potato gnocchi  
- ~100g guanciale, cut into lardons  
- 1 can Mutti San Marzano tomatoes (crushed or broken by hand)  
- 1 small handful Pecorino Romano, finely grated  
- 1 tsp peperoncino flakes or chili flakes (to taste)  
- *Optional:* 1 splash dry red wine (e.g. Montepulciano)  
- *Optional:* 1 garlic clove (smashed, removed before tomato)

## 🔪 Method

1. **Start cold**  
   Place guanciale in a cold pan. Heat slowly over medium-low to render the fat fully and crisp the edges.

2. **Fry the heat**  
   Add peperoncino flakes directly into the hot fat. Let them bloom for 30 seconds — aromatic and spicy.

3. **Deglaze** *(optional)*  
   Add a splash of red wine and reduce until nearly evaporated.

4. **Sauce**  
   Add crushed tomatoes, stir, and reduce heat. Simmer uncovered for 10–15 minutes until thickened. Salt lightly.

5. **Cook gnocchi**  
   Boil in salted water until they float (1–2 min). Optionally pan-fry in olive oil for a golden exterior.

6. **Combine**  
   Add gnocchi to the sauce, toss gently. Off heat, stir in grated Pecorino for silkiness.

7. **Serve**  
   Plate and top with more Pecorino and freshly cracked black pepper.

## 🇮🇹 Cultural Notes & Tips

- **Amatriciana** originates from Amatrice, Lazio. The classic Roman version uses only guanciale, tomato, Pecorino, and chili.
- **No onion or garlic** in traditional recipes, though a smashed garlic clove is sometimes used and removed.
- **Gnocchi is unorthodox**, but it absorbs sauce beautifully and plays well with richness.
- **Peperoncino**: traditional versions bloom the chili in the pork fat. You can also use whole dried chilies torn by hand.
- **Use good Pecorino Romano**, preferably not pre-grated.
- **Don’t discard the guanciale fat** — this “fat-forward” edition uses it all for flavor and texture.
