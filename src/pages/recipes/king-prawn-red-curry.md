## 🔍 Iterative refinements
- ✅ **Coconut + stock:** went with 250 ml each for a lighter, more sip-able broth.
- ✅ **Sugar:** 1 tbsp gula djawa brings enough mellow sweetness without overpowering freshness.
- ✅ **Fish vs oyster:** tried 1 tbsp each for a less salty, more balanced umami.
- ✅ **Kaffir lime:** used zest + halves in simmer, removed before serving to prevent over-bitterness.
- ✅ **Eggplant:** seared first for texture, simmered less to avoid collapse. Consider adding even later next round.
- ✅ **Bell pepper rescue:** added nice crunch & color.

## 💡 Next experiments
- Try all fish sauce for even cleaner Thai style.
- Add more fresh chili for gentle heat.
- Squeeze real fresh lime off heat for sharper top note.
