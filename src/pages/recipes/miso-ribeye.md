## ❤️ Chef notes & next experiments
- Try lightly scoring the cut face of sweet potato for deeper caramel lines.
- Drizzle with honey *or* sprinkle with brown sugar before last 10 min for a near brûlée.
- Broccoli can be replaced with asparagus, green beans, or even kale crisps.
- Miso butter also amazing on chicken, mushrooms, or spread on bread.

## ⚙️ About ovens & the old Carrick
> _"This dish was perfected under the reluctant flame of a Cannon Carrick that barely reached roasting temp, requiring heroic patience and a final grill blast with the door ajar to keep the element lit.  
If your oven actually works, you'll have this on the table in under an hour."_
