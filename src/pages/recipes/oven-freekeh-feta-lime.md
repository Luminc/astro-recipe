## 🔄 Chef’s notes & variations
- **Fish sauce + lime** give it a bright, savory backbone — go slowly, tasting as you go, since both are salty & punchy.
- **Sumac or za’atar** can give a Levantine tilt.  
- Keeps beautifully — next day flavors integrate even more.  
- The roasted aubergine & pumpkin also work great in curries or soups later in the week.

🥂 **Iterative discovery:**  
This is one of those modular foundation recipes — try changing up the herbs (mint, parsley), the nuts (almonds, pistachios), or adding a tahini drizzle for a new branch.
