### Spice Paste (Bumbu Halus)
- 8 shallots

## 🍳 Method

1. **Make the spice paste:**  
   Blend shallots, garlic, chilies, ginger, galangal, candlenuts, coriander and a splash of water into a smooth paste.

2. **Sauté the paste:**  
   In a large wok or heavy pot, cook the bumbu over medium heat until fragrant and oil begins to separate (10–15 min).

3. **Add aromatics:**  
   Stir in lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves, turmeric leaves, star anise, cloves, cinnamon.

4. **Brown the beef:**  
   Add beef pieces and stir well to coat in the aromatic paste.

5. **Pour in coconut milk:**  
   Bring to a gentle simmer. Season with salt and palm sugar.

6. **Slow cook:**  
   Reduce heat to low. Simmer uncovered 2.5–3 hours, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, darkens and oil separates.

7. **Caramelize:**  
   Continue cooking gently until nearly dry, the sauce clings to the beef, and the color turns deep brown. This is key for rendang’s authentic texture.

8. **Rest & serve:**  
   Let sit at least 30 min before eating. Even better the next day. Enjoy with warm rice and seroendeng.

## 💡 Notes

- **Candlenuts** act as a natural thickener. If unavailable, macadamia or a few blanched almonds work.
- **Turmeric leaves** add a signature Padang aroma — skip or add extra lime leaf if needed.
- Rendang **should not be a curry**; cook until almost dry with intense, complex flavors.
