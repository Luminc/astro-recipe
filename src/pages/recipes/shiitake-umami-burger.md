## 🔪 Method

### 1. **Caramelize the onions**  
Low and slow: cook sliced onions with fat, salt, and brown sugar until deep golden (~45–60 min). Optional: add balsamic or soy at the end.

### 2. **Sear mushrooms**  
Brown in a hot pan, salt lightly to draw moisture. Deglaze with a splash of water or beer, then stir in glaze. Turn off heat and coat mushrooms.

### 3. **Prepare the patties**  
Season with umami salt, sear in hot pan 2–3 min per side. Optional: cheese melt in final minute.

### 4. **Toast the buns**  
Spread mayo (or neutral mayo mix) on cut sides and grill until golden. Add a dollop of **miso mayo** on top bun after grilling.

### 5. **Assemble**
1. Bottom bun (crispy mayo side down)  
2. Jammy onions  
3. Burger patty  
4. Glazed shiitake

## 💡 Tips & Notes

- **Miso mayo** adds umami, acidity, and creaminess — works both in the burger and on the side.
- **Seaweed salt** gives a subtle briny note, but **furikake** has more visual and flavor impact.
- **Jammy onions** can be made in advance — they improve overnight.
- Want heat? Add gochujang or sriracha to the mayo for a spicy kick.
