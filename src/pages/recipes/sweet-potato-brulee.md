This builds on our earlier burger onions, now paired with a **signature modular br√ªl√©e potato**. Each element stands alone ‚Äî imagine the potatoes next to steak, the onions folded into pasta, or the tomatoes over toast.

## üî™ Method

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prep the sweet potatoes
- Preheat oven to high heat (your Cannon Carrick went up to '7' then '9').
- Place potatoes cut-side up on foil (for easy cleanup).  
- Drizzle with oil, season with salt.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Roast
- Roast for about **1 hour**, turning tray if needed. They‚Äôre done when extremely fork-tender.  
- Towards the last 10-15 min, **brush with the kecap manis + ginger syrup glaze**.  
- Optionally sprinkle a little brown sugar to encourage br√ªl√©eing.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Char under grill
- Switch to grill setting, door slightly ajar for gas flow.  
- Allow tops to caramelize and char. Watch closely to avoid burning.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Caramelize the onions
- Meanwhile, slowly sweat diced onions in oil over medium-low heat until golden.  
- Deglaze with a splash of Viognier (or any white wine).  
- Add a teaspoon balsamic if desired, cook until jammy.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Roast the tomatoes
- Add tomatoes to the oven or grill for the last 15-20 min. They should split and soften.

## üçΩ Plate & Finish
- Arrange sweet potato halves, roasted tomatoes, and eggs on the plate.  
- Top with caramelized onions and freshly grated pecorino.

## üîç Reflections & future notes
- Cutting the sweet potato lengthwise creates an impressive look but watch thickness for even cooking. Try slicing slightly smaller for balanced br√ªl√©e.
- The Cannon Carrick oven, while temperamental, delivered with patience.  
- Eggs could be improved with a cast iron skillet to avoid sticking.
- This plate is part of our growing **modular system**:  
  - üß© The br√ªl√©e sweet potato is a staple side for steak, chicken, or stand-alone.  
  - üß© Caramelized onions can top burgers, pasta, or mix into grain bowls.
  - üß© The glaze is adaptable ‚Äî great on skewers, or as a reduction sauce.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Philosophy
Cooking isn‚Äôt a rigid path but a living tree ‚Äî branching, returning, circling back to deepen roots.  
Forgive fumbles. Accept rust. Each session polishes skill.  
This is our git-like iterative cookbook: track, adapt, and honor both hits and misses.

## üç∑ Suggested pairings
- A glass of Viognier to echo your cooking splash.
- A slice of fresh bread to mop up sweet-salty onion jam.

**Next up:** Maybe try a version with a sugar torch for true glass crunch, or bring in broccoli for a green counterpoint.
