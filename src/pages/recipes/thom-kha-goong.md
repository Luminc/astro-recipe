## 🔄 Chef’s notes
- You used slightly old kaffir lime leaves from the freezer, still great — plus the whole kaffir lime was an inspired addition.
- A delicate soup that gets even better the next day (like your curry), though shrimp can toughen if over-reheated.
- Next time: try a few cherry tomatoes tossed in for a classic tom yum-style pop.

🍜 **Iterative discovery:**  
- Your first was direct from Pailin, with your signature tweaks.  
- Next time could explore chicken (Tom Kha Gai) or a mix of shrimp & tofu.  
- Also: experiment with a dash of roasted chili jam (*nam prik pao*) stirred in for depth.
