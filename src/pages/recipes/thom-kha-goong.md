## 📝 Description
A bright, creamy Thai coconut soup inspired by Pailin (Hot Thai Kitchen), made with galangal, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves — plus your twist of an *actual kaffir lime*.  
Loaded with juicy shrimp & shiitake mushrooms, it’s deeply aromatic and just slightly spicy.

## 🛒 Ingredients
- ~350 ml coconut milk (Aroy-D)
- ~250 ml chicken stock (from cube, ideally homemade)
- 1 stalk lemongrass, bruised & cut into pieces
- 5-6 slices fresh galangal (or frozen, thawed)
- 3-4 kaffir lime leaves (bit old, from freezer is fine)
- 1 small kaffir lime, halved (your twist)
- A handful of shiitake mushrooms, sliced
- ~10 raw king prawns or shrimp, deveined
- A few Thai chilies (to taste)
- 2 tbsp fish sauce (Squid brand)
- 1-2 tbsp Gula Djawa (or palm sugar)
- Juice of 1 lime
- Fresh coriander to garnish

## 🔪 Instructions

### 1. Build the broth
- In a pot over medium, combine **half the coconut milk** and **all the stock**.
- Add **lemongrass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves**, and your **halved kaffir lime**.
- Let it come to a gentle simmer to infuse — **~5-10 min**.

### 2. Season & finish
- Add **shiitake mushrooms** and simmer a few more minutes.
- Stir in the remaining **coconut milk**, **fish sauce**, **Gula Djawa**, and **chilies**.
- Simmer gently, avoid boiling hard.

### 3. Add the shrimp
- Once the soup is hot, add **shrimp** and poach until just cooked (2-3 min).

### 4. Balance
- Turn off the heat. Stir in **fresh lime juice**, taste and adjust:  
  - more fish sauce for salt,  
  - more sugar for roundness,  
  - more lime for tang.

## 🥗 Serving
- Ladle into bowls.  
- Top with fresh coriander.

Perfect paired with leftover **freekeh salad** as you did —  
a delightful two-course meal.

## 🔄 Chef’s notes
- You used slightly old kaffir lime leaves from the freezer, still great — plus the whole kaffir lime was an inspired addition.
- A delicate soup that gets even better the next day (like your curry), though shrimp can toughen if over-reheated.
- Next time: try a few cherry tomatoes tossed in for a classic tom yum-style pop.

🍜 **Iterative discovery:**  
- Your first was direct from Pailin, with your signature tweaks.  
- Next time could explore chicken (Tom Kha Gai) or a mix of shrimp & tofu.  
- Also: experiment with a dash of roasted chili jam (*nam prik pao*) stirred in for depth.
